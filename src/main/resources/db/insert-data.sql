  (1, 2, 1, 'Its as much of a non-film as I can remember. Somehow, Spielberg made a cup of water and the sound of footsteps far more suspenseful and engaging than anything in this movie. The dinosaurs are just sort of... there. Same goes for Chris Pratt, who features in scenes but only mildly forwarding the story with a few rescues or whatever. There are some cringe-worthy moments - firing a gun underwater to break glass, everyone being submersed but having perfect hair/makeup after, a horribly acted young girl who has the most shoe-horned and pointless subplot ever (as well as a nonsensical, cringe inducing climactic line). So much of the story makes no sense, a hybrid dino is basically produced and supposedly trained to follow laser sighting overnight. Yet has no buildup, suspense or point whatsoever. The whole thing is stranger than a David Lynch movie. Its like a string of bland cutscenes to a dull videogame.', '2018-06-11'),
  (2, 2, 2, 'Your going to be hard pressed to find a movie more over the top than Deadpool 2, David leitch takes it to a whole new level entirely. It works namely because the violence here is just to creative. Sure it defies all Logic most of the time, but i was laughing and having a rip-roaring time throughout.\n\nGo into this movie knowing that it is a campy, corny, over the top superhero/action/comedy that is just about crazy shooting sequences and one-liners, and you\'ll be fine. Do not go into this movie expecting deep plot, meaningful conversations among characters, or anything remotely resembling a serious action or drama movie.\n\nLoved it....', '2018-06-11'),

It takes everything that was great about the first one and makes it even better!\n\nDavid Leitch proves once again to be one of the best current directors in the genre of action, with really gory, fun fights. Also, the whole cast is great, but my favorite was Josh Brolin as Cable, I even liked him more here than in Infinity War.\n\nIf you liked the first one, please, go check this out!', '2018-06-12'),

Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.', '2018-06-12'),
  (6, 3, 5, 'After watching this movie I was totally filled with enthusiasm. Fight Club is definitly Fincher\'s best movie even better than se7en. It\'s not only the story but the optics which fascinated me. When I had seen it for the second time I could see this movie with the knowledge of the conclusion which is really fascinating as you\'ll see Fight Club in a totally different perspective. Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song \'Where is my mind\' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn\'t have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it\'s quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar.', '2018-06-12'),
  (7, 3, 6, 'When I first saw this movie I didn\'t appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn\'t as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don\'t like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there\'s no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn\'t seen it or who thinks that don\'t like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...', '2018-06-12'),
  (8, 3, 7, 'It\'s been a while since a movie has generated enough interest in me for me to watch it. \"The Matrix\" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look. What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I\'ve ever seen. The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more. Say what you want about Keanu Reeves\' acting. He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film. He was a great choice for the role of Neo. Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne. I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies. It will blow away your senses...', '2018-06-12'),
  (9, 3, 8, 'Watching The Matrix Reloaded, one is absolutely entitled to say that it is overloaded, too lengthy action sequences for instance, and indeed, a way too lengthy dancing scene in Zion. But next to that, it is obvious that this sequal to The Matrix (1999)takes the story to a whole new dimension. Different characters define the working of the matrix, and the meaning of life itself, in different ways, depending on their onthological background. A conclusion is not (yet) given, which adds to the movie a kind of postmodern quality. For as far as the action sequences are concerned: Groundbreaking. You\'ll see stuff that you\'ve never seen before. Sometimes the scenes are a little lengthy, which harmes the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the visual spectacle. And yes, the Architect at the end is difficult to understand, but when you watch the film more than once, you\'ll find out that it does make sense what he says. All together this movie may not be as fantastic as \'The Matrix\', but it is definitely a good movie that will keep you thinking for a while.', '2018-06-13'),
  (10, 3, 9, 'Matrix Revolutions is a revolution of a movie and shows that the brothers wont stop at a half worked job. the attention to detail and cinematography of the real world makes you shocked at how much work was really put into this film. In my opinion no one will be able to match the hugeness of the matrix trilogy for a long time. a job well done and a movie definitely worth seeing, even if you didn\'t like the 2nd one.', '2018-06-13'),
  (11, 3, 10, 'I knew nothing of this film before I saw it by chance in a rare Pub open screening, but boy was I glad I got the chance to take a look. I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts. I walked away afterwards, beaming. It\'s rare a great film like this is made, especially these days. I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can.', '2018-06-13'),
  (12, 3, 11, 'A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence. I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are. Edward Norton\'s performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a vengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and you feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2 hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt quite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite shocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer. Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him. Peace and Love, JB33 Rating 5 stars', '2018-06-13'),
  (13, 3, 12, 'What fun I had at this movie! The whole experience, from the crowd cheering and excitement as the words \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away\" appeared, to the music, the opening scenes as Qui Gon and Obi Won battled the droids, to the escape of Queen Amidala, to the pod racing, to the unleashing of Darth Maul, to the climatic fight, etc., etc.! This was a great time. I hear some complain that it wasn\'t anything like the first Star Wars, A New Hope. Well, of course not! Had it been, everyone would have complained that all they did was try to recapture the magic of the first movie! I highly recommend this movie to anyone, any age, anywhere!', '2018-06-14'),
  (14, 3, 13, 'This episode of the Star wars saga was criticized by some when it came out for having wooden dialogue and too much digital landscaping to be any good. I wasn\'t overly impressed with it myself, but having seen all 6 films now, AOTC is actually a very important and well done section of the overall series.\n\nLucas has said time and again that this movies are meant to be seen as one long film, not to be taken as 6 individual movies. This particular installment features so much that affects every other episode. The discovery of the clones, the immaturity and arrogance of Annakin, the beginning of the clone wars. All of these events happen in this one movie, which is actually a lot more than what happens in some of the other films. I don\'t consider this to be the best of all 6 by any means, but it is certainly not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.', '2018-06-14'),
  (15, 4, 1, 'I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last.', '2018-06-14'),
  (16, 4, 11, 'This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you\'re on in life, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn\'t mean you can play God and try to make things \"your way\" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full.', '2018-06-14'),
  (17, 4, 13, 'Easily the most tedious film of the year and of the series and of the genre. You\'d find better action sequences on a cheap games console and better acting in a primary school production of the wizard of oz. And the blame lies squarely on Lucas\' shoulders. This kind of dialogue would get you kicked out of film school. Dribbled with strained references to the original series and delivered with the verve of a George W. Bush speech on international trade agreements. The only people who come out relatively unscathed are the traditionally camped-up hammer-horror-style bad guys and Ewan McGregor\'s continuing pastiche of Alec Guinness. The \"romantic\" leads are like being forced to watch the world\'s least interesting high-school sweethearts pretending to have a squabble. Wait until it appears on DVD then at least you can edit it down to a three minute Natalie Portman fashion shoot and fifty seconds of yoda break-dancing.', '2018-06-14'),
  (18, 5, 1, ' can\'t believe how many 10/10 I see on here, either big cgi fans or people who haven\'t seen any other Jurassic Park movie could rate this 10/10!\n\nThe movie is a slow burner, it just never felt as if it could get going, predictable action scenes, terrible story (full of plot holes) and the acting was pretty bad too! It\'s as if they were trying too hard to better JW and failed miserably. As a fan of the franchise I was left bitterly disappointed with the end result of fallen kingdom, it could have been so much better but in the end this movie was poorly executed, after that I don\'t think there should be a third JW unless a different director takes the helm.', '2018-06-15'),

  (20, 5, 3, 'I enjoyed every minute in this movie. This will become an instant classic and one of the best movies Marvel has made. From the first scene i was blown away. If you are 12 or older i highly recommend you watch this movie. I can\'t say more without spoiling the movie so go see it. I was at the cinema with my girlfriend and she is not a Deadpool fan, but after she saw the movie she wanted to buy the Deadpool comics to learn more about him. This is how good the movie was. The first 15- 20 minutes of the movie are probably the best intro to a movie i have ever seen. And here is a tip. Stay after the ending credits. You will not regret it.', '2018-06-16');
